Backpropagation , short for \"backward propagation of errors\" is an algorithm for supervised learning of artificial neural networks using gradient descent. Latent space , also known as a latent feature space or embedding space , is a vector space spanned by the latent variables. Latent variables are variables which are not directly observable. - Position within the latent space can be viewed as being defined by a set of latent variables that emerge from the resemblances from the objects. - The construction of a latent space is an example of dimensionality reduction, which can also be viewed as a form of data compression. Manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. - One-dimensional manifolds include lines and circles, but not lemniscates. - Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces. Examples include the plane, the sphere, and the torus, and also the Klein bottle and real projective plane. Topological space is a geometrical space in which closeness is defined but cannot necessarily be measured by a numeric distance. Topology is a structure allows defining continuous deformation of subspaces, and, more generally, all kinds of continuity. Topology studies how a shape or object is connected. If we have a notion of distance then we can say when things are close to each other. However, distance is not necessary to determine when things are close to each other. Invariant is a property of a mathematical object remains unchanged after certain operations. A binary operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands does not change the result.

An adjacent vertex of a vertex v in a graph is a vertex that is connected to v by an edge. Symmetry group of a geometric object is the group of all transformations under which the object is invariant, endowed with the group operation of composition. Message passing algorithms are distributed algorithms that operate on graphs, where each node uses only information present locally at the node and incident edges, and send information only to its neighbouring nodes. Representation learning transform raw data into suitable internal representation. Computation geometry is a geometry in extracting useful information from physical shapes tiled with polygons on visual scenes. Computational topology useful in establishing the nearness or apartness of nonempty sets of cell complexes (connected vertices, edges and filled triangles). cellular complexes (collections of vertices, line segments, filled triangles, cycles, vortexes, nerves) Homology focuses on how space is connected that provide insights into how the pieces of a visual scene can be connected to each other. Group $G$ is a nonempty set equipped with a binary operation * that is associative and in which there is an identity element e and every member a in G has an inverse b, i.e., a * b = e. Cyclic group H is a group in which every member of G can be written as a positive integral power of a single element called a generator . Cyclic groups are useful in representing how the pieces of a visual scene that are attached to each other and connected together. Cyclic group is Abelian , provided a * b = b * a, for every pair elements in G. Free abelian group is an Abelian group with multiple generators Betti numbers counts of the number of generators in a free Abelian group. Hausdorff space is a nonempty set in which every point resides in a neighbourhood that is disjoint from every other neighbourhood of the points in the space. Contours is a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary)having same color or intensity. Structure means some meaningful collection of the parts of an image \\cite{peters2014topology}. Collection connotes a grouping the pixels in an image based on some scheme \\cite{peters2014topology}. Feature is a piece of information about the content of an image. Spatial relation specifies how some object is located in space in relation to some reference object. A region in an image is a group of connected pixels with similar properties. Compression ~ Dimension Reduction ~ Cell Collapsing Fine & coarse segmentation pixel also picture element Global modeling is a machine learning approach that aims to learn models that can make predictions based on the entire input, rather than just a local patch or region of the input. Convolution in a CNN is performed by sliding a small window or kernel across the input and applying a set of weights to the values within the window to produce a new output value. This process is repeated for each location in the input, and the resulting outputs are combined to form a new feature map. Contrastive learning is a machine learning approach that aims to learn representations of data that are robust to variations in the data. This is typically achieved by training a model to maximize the similarity between similar examples in the dataset and minimize the similarity between dissimilar examples. Long-range context relationships refer to the relationships between elements in a dataset that are distant from each other in terms of their position or location. In an image, long-range context relationships may involve the relationships between pixels that are far apart from each other in the image. Feature pyramid is a multi-scale feature extractor that is used to extract features from the input image at multiple scales. how is affinity matrix related - An affinity matrix is a matrix that represents the relationships or connections between elements in a dataset. In the context of image segmentation, an affinity matrix is often used to represent the relationships between pixels in an image, with each element in the matrix representing the similarity or \"affinity\" between a pair of pixels. - The affinity matrix can be used in a variety of ways in the context of image segmentation. For example, it can be used to define the edges of a graph that represents the image, with the elements of the affinity matrix defining the weights of the edges. The affinity matrix can then be used to compute the graph Laplacian, which can be used to smooth or regularize the image. - The affinity matrix can also be used to compute the pairwise distances between pixels in the image, which can be used to define the similarity between pixels. This similarity can then be used to cluster the pixels into different groups or regions, which can be useful for tasks such as image segmentation or object detection. A walk in a graph is a sequence of edges that connects a sequence of vertices. It can start and end at different vertex, and a vertex may be visited more than once. The order in which the vertices and edges are traversed is important. A walk can be open, if it starts and ends at different vertex, or closed, if it starts and ends at the same vertex. Pyramid method is a technique used to reduce the resolution of an image while retaining important details. The pyramid method involves creating a series of images of the same scene, each at a lower resolution than the previous one. This is typically done by repeatedly applying a smoothing filter and then downsampling the image. The resulting images form a pyramid, with the original image at the top, and each successive level of the pyramid having a lower resolution. In image processing, the Non-local algorithm is used to improve the quality of images that have been degraded by noise or other distortions. It does this by considering the similarity of each feature position to all other feature positions in the image.","title":"Terms"},{"location":"machine_learning/term/#terms","text":"Artificial intelligence is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.

I will share my experience as a computer science graduate in Malaysia. All my research experience is entirely focused only on deep learning. In my Bachelor's final year project, I got the chance to explore image classification using Convolutional Network. That experience just gave me little research exposure, as I didn't manage to complete it. Just so I thought I would say bye to research, a Master's opportunity came up. This time the study is on text classification. So I changed the domain from image to text. I spent my years doing incremental work, adding something to the input and tweaking the model to increase the classification accuracy. I was not too fond of that research, so I looked up something new in my PhD. On why continuing PhD, I want to explore a career as a researcher. I think landing a job with a PhD degree and relevant experience is easier. I would want to clarify three things before you continue the reading.

I even hated to do coding before I started my Master, but I am not bad at it, just mediocre. Secondly, I was still not good at doing research after my Master, and so did my output.

A few things to note before starting a PhD. If you are in a dilemma about doing a full-time PhD, you need to consider your family situation. If your family depends on you, you better work until someone in your family can replace you. An issue other than family issues would be peer pressure. You will undoubtedly meet peer pressure when you see your friends working out there, earning more than you and enjoying life. Oh, did I mention getting PhD would not make you earn more? So, the solid answer for why doing a PhD is to become a professor or scientist. Remember that \"personal happiness\" is always the priority over \"personal wealth\".

I will share my experience as a computer science graduate in Malaysia. All my research experience is entirely focused only on deep learning. In my Bachelor's final year project, I got the chance to explore image classification using Convolutional Network. That experience just gave me little research exposure, as I didn't manage to complete it. Just so I thought I would say bye to research, a Master's opportunity came up. This time the study is on text classification. So I changed the domain from image to text. I spent my years doing incremental work, adding something to the input and tweaking the model to increase the classification accuracy. I was not too fond of that research, so I looked up something new in my PhD. On why continuing PhD, I want to explore a career as a researcher. I think landing a job with a PhD degree and relevant experience is easier. I would want to clarify three things before you continue the reading.

I find a way to represent an image as a graph for semantic segmentation. Image is the RGB or grayscale picture we can view on our computer. The graph here is not the visualisation chart but a structure comprising node and edge. Semantic segmentation is an image segmentation that separates the foreground (object) and the background into a semantic category (like human and sky). Usually, an image is represented as a grid of pixels on the computer. In dealing with images, the go-to technique is a convolutional network. So, I trained a convolutional model to segment the fluid spray images. The model works as it finds the corresponding objects in the image. However, from the predicted result, I see some false contouring, which will falsely increase the number of objects in the image. This false increase in the number of predicted objects will mess up the decision of whether to service an engine that the spray comes out from. Through a few readings, I realise that convolution in grid representation will cause topological errors. Then I thought, if I change the image representation, will the problem be resolved? Motivated by how humans recognise an object in a scene, I believe using a graph to represent an image is promising. I will need to work on my first-year defence writing (proposal defence), so I didn't manage to run an experiment to prove that. You might wonder why it sounds like I need a long time for that. The thing is, IT IS. You realise what you missed when writing. We do not learn from the research paper on learning a new concept. We identify the gap and trend from the paper, then learn the fundamentals from the textbook. Learning takes time, quite some time. Why so? If you know a bit of something, then quickly go to the next concept. What's the implication? It will cause a learning gap, a serious problem we must solve. For example, we know 80% of Concept 1 and then learn Concept 2. That missing 20% is crucial to understanding Concept 2. Next, we will look at proposal defence.","title":"Exploration"},{"location":"phd/exploration/#exploration","text":"In my PhD, I am working on representation learning.

What image contain? - Image is composed by pixels with different intensity value. How semantic segmentation is done? - Semantic segmentation is a task that classify each pixel in the image to a label. CNN learn the changes among a set of connected pixels. Prominent changes and repeated parts will be in learnt model. Long-term context relationship refers to the relationship between different regions or objects in an image over a longer period of time. Contextual information refers to the information that surrounds a specific object or region in an image, that can be useful for disambiguating objects or making more accurate predictions. Conditional Random Field (CRF) allows the model to take into account the relationship between different regions in an image. How it is being done? - Traditional CV algorithm - thresholding - histogram-based bundling - region growing - k-means clustering - watersheds - active contours - graph cuts - conditional and Markov random fields - sparsity based methods How people doing it now? - Deep Learning - Fully convolutional networks / fully convolutional pixel-labeling networks - Convolutional models with graphical models - Encoder-decoder based models - Multi-scale and pyramid network based models - Dilated convolutional models and DeepLab family - Recurrent neural network based models - Attention-based models - Generative models and adversarial training - Convolutional models with active contour models What's the problem with this task? - While the deep learning model is capable to achieve good segmentation result, the technique is highly dependent on big dataset for training.
