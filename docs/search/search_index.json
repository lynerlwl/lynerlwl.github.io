An engineer who doesn't know science is not an engineer. - The learning gap is a serious problem that we must solve. For example, we know 80% of concept 1 and move on to learn concept 2. That missing 20% is crucial to understanding concept 2. - We do not learn from the research paper. We identify the gap and trend, then learn the fundamentals from the textbook. Some life thoughts: - It is hard to maintain the same state in life. If you can't improve, then you will likely deteriorate. - Truth is always harsh, but you need honest feedback and learn from it. You have to thank those who speak the truth, as they risk their relationship with you. Even if you don't like it, you must keep your manner. Friends may come and go, but enemies accumulate. - People count projects you finish, not the ones you start. The same goes for skill; you tell people what you know, not what you plan to know. - When explaining something, keep things simple unless there is a good reason not to. - Confidence didn't come from how well you know the subject but from your ability to cope with unforeseen situations. Thought on choosing a full-time PhD: - If you are in a dilemma about doing a PhD full-time, first think about your family situation. If your family is dependent on you, you better go work until someone in your family can replace you. - During your study, remember that \"personal happiness\" is always the priority over \"personal wealth\". Personal finance is a general term; what you must adopt is budgeting. Though the study process is challenging, family first study second.","title":"Thought"},{"location":"research/note/","text":"Research Research is a long process, when done in a wrong mood, it becomes dull.

Algorithmic game theory (AGT) is an area in the intersection of game theory and computer science, with the objective of understanding and design of algorithms in strategic environments. Online algorithm is one that can process its input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion. Approximation algorithms are efficient algorithms that find approximate solutions to optimization problems (in particular NP-hard problems) with provable guarantees on the distance of the returned solution to the optimal one. Maximin share (MMS) is a criterion of fair item allocation. Given a set of items with different values, the 1-out-of-n maximin-share is the maximum value that can be gained by partitioning the items into n parts and taking the part with the minimum value. Monte Carlo algorithm is a randomized algorithm whose output may be incorrect with a certain (typically small) probability. Control theory deals with the control of dynamical systems in engineered processes and machines. The objective is to develop an algorithm governing the application of system inputs to drive the system to a desired state, while minimizing any delay, overshoot, or steady-state error and ensuring a level of control stability; often with the aim to achieve a degree of optimality. Dynamic data structure (DDS) refers to a collection of data in memory that has the flexibility to grow or shrink in size, enabling a programmer to control exactly how much memory is utilized. Retroactive data structure supports efficient modifications to a sequence of operations that have been performed on the structure. Ubiquitous computing is a concept where computing is made to appear anytime and everywhere. Context awareness refers to a capability to take into account the situation of entities, which may be users or devices, but are not limited to those. Narrowly defined for mobile devices, context awareness does thus generalize location awareness. Network communication or internetworking , defines a set of protocols (rules and standards) that allow application programs to talk with each other without regard to the hardware and operating systems where they are run. Internetworking allows application programs to communicate independently of their physical network connections. Plant phenotyping is an emerging science that links genomics with plant ecophysiology and agronomy. Intelligent sensor is a sensor that takes some predefined action when it senses the appropriate input (light, heat, sound, motion, touch). Indoor positioning system (IPS) is a network of devices used to locate people or objects where GPS and other satellite technologies lack precision or fail entirely.","title":"Technical Terms"},{"location":"technical/tech_term/#technical-terms","text":"Social science is the branch of science devoted to the study of societies and the relationships among individuals within those societies.
