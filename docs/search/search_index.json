We have three parts in this series, and the hardware mentioned is based on the mid-end gaming rig I built. The essential components of a PC consist of the following: (1) Case : Protect the components and have a switch to turn on your computer. (2) Mainboard : As the backbone of the computer. (3) Processor / CPU : As the brain of the computer. (4) Memory / RAM : To store information that needs to be used quickly. (5) Storage : To host the operating system (most likely Windows) and store your files. (6) Power Supply / PSU : To power up the computer. (7) Graphic card / GPU (optional): The first thing is to choose a casing size. The common sizes are itx, matx, atx. You can think of itx as the small size, matx as the medium size, atx as the large size. We will be using matx as the example. Now we have chosen the casing size, let's look at the mainboard. I recommend using this search term for a better deal \"intel mainboard combo\". Three info in the mainboard are important: the size, supported processor, and supported ram. Take \"GIGABYTE B760M D2H DDR4 LGA1700\" as the example: DDR4 is the RAM type, and LGA 1700 is the processor socket, which we can use to find a compatible processor. We chose the CPU \"Intel i5 13400\", which supports DDR4 and DDR5 RAM. The RAM we chose is \"Kingston Fury Beast 16GB 3200\", which has 16GB of memory and 3200mhz (the higher number higher the speed). For the storage, unless you need HDD to store files, I would suggest just opt for SSD as the speed is faster. We choose \"Kingston NV1 NVMe M.2 SSD 1TB\", which looks like a small thin stick rather than a conventional hard disc. The choice of power supply depends on the graphic card you will be using. I suggest going for the one with a higher power for safety reasons. We are using \"GIGABYTE GeForce RTX4060 TI\", so the power supply we chose, \"Corsair RM 750e Gold\" is slightly more than enough. Here I'm listing a summary of the build mentioned: (1) Case: Cooler Master MasterBox Q300L (2) Mainboard: GIGABYTE B760M D2H DDR4 LGA1700 (3) Processor / CPU: Intel i5 13400 LGA1700 (4) Memory / RAM: Kingston Fury Beast 16GB 3200 (5) Storage: Kingston NV1 NVMe M.2 SSD 1TB (6) Power Supply / PSU: Corsair RM 750e Gold (7) Graphic card / GPU (optional): GIGABYTE GeForce RTX4060 TI EAGLE 8GB Next, we will look at installing the hardware .","title":"Pc diy buying hardware"},{"location":"blog/pc-diy-installing-hardware/","text":"Let's first look at motherboard. Take out the plastic cover at the CPU slot. Then, take out CPU from the CPU package. Put the CPU into the slot following the arrow direction at the bottom.

I will have to first emphasise \"reading is harder than you think\", to avoid people take this for granted. If you read without thinking and forming your own conclusions, the reading is just browsing the information. It just have little effect on you. That is what happened to most people when they read or watch something, their information pool increased, but not their knowledge pool. Information is not knowledge, if you cannot interprete it. Depends on who reading the content, to some is knowledge, to some is information. Data -> Information -> Knowledge. That bring us the simplified equation of Kowledge = Theory + Information. Data is meaningless without theory, the only souce of knowledge is experience. Data is symbols that decribe things. Information is meaningful data. Knowledge is useful info. For example, you saw ddr4 on the box of a motherboard, that ddr4 is data Once you know that ddr4 in one of the specs of a motherboard, that become an information. Knowledge comes in when you know you need to install RAM stick with ddr4 to the motherboard for the PC to run and not ddr5. Learning is never easy. I end this article with the idea of Denis Diderot (French Philosopher) on acquiring knowledge.

I will share my experience as a computer science graduate in Malaysia. All my research experience is entirely focused only on deep learning. In my Bachelor's final year project, I got the chance to explore image classification using Convolutional Network. That experience gave me little research exposure, as I didn't manage to complete the assigned task. Just so I thought I would say bye to research, a Master's opportunity came up. The study this time is on text classification. So I changed the domain from image to text. I spent my years doing incremental work, adding something to the input and tweaking the model to increase the classification accuracy. I was not too fond of that research, so I looked up something new in my PhD. On why continuing PhD, I want to explore a career as a researcher. Landing a job with a PhD degree and relevant experience is more accessible. I would want to clarify three things before you continue the reading. 1. Firstly, I am not a bright student with first-class honours and lots of technical experience. I got a second-upper, for those who wondered. I even hated to do coding before I started my Master, but I am not bad at it, just mediocre. 2. Secondly, I was still not good at doing research after my Master, and so did my output. My best work has been published in IEEE Access. 3. Lastly, I also didn't have good English, so writing was not easy for me. I tell you these facts to inform you that you can do research even if you are not smart. Just keep the difficulty to your level, so you will be motivated, as stated in the Goldilocks Rule . There are a few things to note before starting a PhD. If you are in dilemma about doing a full-time PhD, you need to consider your family situation. If your family depends on you, you better work until someone in your family can replace you. An issue other than family issues would be peer pressure. You will undoubtedly meet peer pressure when you see your friends working out there, earning more than you, and enjoying life. Oh, did I mention getting PhD would not make you earn more? So, the solid answer for why doing a PhD is to become a professor or scientist. Remember that \"personal happiness\" is always the priority over \"personal wealth\". Just keep in mind that you must adopt budgeting as a practice of personal finance.

I find a way to represent an image as a graph for semantic segmentation. Image is the RGB or grayscale picture we can view on our computer. The graph here is not the visualisation chart but a structure comprising node and edge. Semantic segmentation is an image segmentation that separates the foreground (object) and the background into a semantic category (like human and sky). Usually, an image is represented as a grid of pixels on the computer. In dealing with images, the go-to technique is a convolutional network. So, I trained a convolutional model to segment the liquid spray images. The model works as it finds the corresponding objects in the image. However, from the predicted result, I see some false contouring, which will falsely increase the number of objects in the image. This false increase in the number of predicted objects will mess up the decision of whether to service an engine that the spray comes out from. Through a few readings, I realise that convolution in grid representation will cause topological errors. Then I thought, if I change the image representation, will the problem be resolved? Motivated by how humans recognise an object in a scene, I believe using a graph to represent an image is promising. I will need to work on my first-year defence writing (proposal defence), so I didn't manage to run an experiment to prove that. You might wonder why it sounds like I need a long time for that. The thing is, IT IS. You realise what you missed when writing. We do not learn from the research paper on learning a new concept. We identify the gap and trend from the article, then learn the fundamentals from the textbook. Learning takes time, quite some time. Why so? If you know a bit of something, then quickly go to the next concept. What's the implication? It will cause a learning gap, a serious problem we must solve. For example, we know 80% of Concept 1 and then learn Concept 2. That missing 20% is crucial to understanding Concept 2. Let's talk about the proposal defense. At this stage, the proposal differs from the document you submitted for PhD admission. This proposal is the draft thesis of chapters one to three (Introduction, Literature Review, and Methodology). You must showcase your problem and hypothesis to convince others that your research direction is clear. It is best to do your preliminary experiment at least to validate the research hypothesis. Usually, 20 minutes will be given to present your proposal. Remember, you must tell a story to convince others that your direction is firm.

Like other career, your body decide your outcome. To perform well in research, you must make sure you got enough sleep, healthy diet, and enough exercise. Secondly, the environment. There is no a fixed place to conduct your research, it changes like you mood. Quatitative vs Qualitative research Process of collecting and analyzing numerical vs nonnumerical data. About Reading and Writing - You have to read and write often, at least 2 days per week. Just like go to gym, have to be consistent. After reading one article, record the main takeaway. When reading an article In first read, focus on abstract, introduction, conclusion. Always read multiple times until you think it is enough. So you shouldn't spend too long time on single paper. When writing an article, there's few choices: A research article is normally refereed, and it is prepared from other report published earlier. It can be journal or conference paper. Journal paper contain more pages thus can include more information, it is suitable for review paper & extended work of conference paper. Conference paper contain less information as it is limited by page numbers. Only in the field of CS and EE, conference paper is view pretigious than journal paper. A technical report is written with a view to keeping a claim on the matter concerned should the need arise later. It is not referred.

Journal paper contain more pages thus can include more information, it is suitable for review paper & extended work of conference paper. Conference paper contain less information as it is limited by page numbers. Only in the field of CS and EE, conference paper is view pretigious than journal paper.

Images is a function $I$ of $x$ and $y$: $I(x,y)$, which xy is the pixel's position. Color images as functions: $f(x,y) = [r(x,y)\\ g(x,y)\\ b(x,y)]$. f: [x_1, x_2] x [y_1, y_2] -> [ , ] (intensity) f: R x R -> R A 3-channel color image is a mapping from a 2D space of locations to a 3D space of color intensity values. f: R x R -> R^3 For digital images, we typically operate on discrete images, which (i) sample 2D space on a regular grid and (ii) quantize each sample that round the number to nearest integer. Image thus represented as a matrix of integer values. If we visualise the image using plot, we can see the intensity is arranged in a way that higher intensity having higher amplitude. So, high-frequency signal means those having high intensity.

This process is repeated for each location in the input, and the resulting outputs are combined to form a new feature map. Contrastive learning is a machine learning approach that aims to learn representations of data that are robust to variations in the data.

Long-range context relationships refer to the relationships between elements in a dataset that are distant from each other in terms of their position or location. In an image, long-range context relationships may involve the relationships between pixels that are far apart from each other in the image. Feature pyramid is a multi-scale feature extractor that is used to extract features from the input image at multiple scales. how is affinity matrix related - An affinity matrix is a matrix that represents the relationships or connections between elements in a dataset. In the context of image segmentation, an affinity matrix is often used to represent the relationships between pixels in an image, with each element in the matrix representing the similarity or \"affinity\" between a pair of pixels. - The affinity matrix can be used in a variety of ways in the context of image segmentation. For example, it can be used to define the edges of a graph that represents the image, with the elements of the affinity matrix defining the weights of the edges. The affinity matrix can then be used to compute the graph Laplacian, which can be used to smooth or regularize the image. - The affinity matrix can also be used to compute the pairwise distances between pixels in the image, which can be used to define the similarity between pixels. This similarity can then be used to cluster the pixels into different groups or regions, which can be useful for tasks such as image segmentation or object detection. A walk in a graph is a sequence of edges that connects a sequence of vertices. It can start and end at different vertex, and a vertex may be visited more than once. The order in which the vertices and edges are traversed is important. A walk can be open, if it starts and ends at different vertex, or closed, if it starts and ends at the same vertex. Pyramid method is a technique used to reduce the resolution of an image while retaining important details. The pyramid method involves creating a series of images of the same scene, each at a lower resolution than the previous one. This is typically done by repeatedly applying a smoothing filter and then downsampling the image. The resulting images form a pyramid, with the original image at the top, and each successive level of the pyramid having a lower resolution. In image processing, the Non-local algorithm is used to improve the quality of images that have been degraded by noise or other distortions. It does this by considering the similarity of each feature position to all other feature positions in the image.","title":"Terms"},{"location":"technical/term/#terms","text":"Artificial intelligence is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.
