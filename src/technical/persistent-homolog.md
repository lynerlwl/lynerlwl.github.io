# Applying Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to Image Segmentation

When I come across topological data analysis, I often see the term persistent homology appear around shape analysis. I'm here to talk about my opinion of that in image segmentation.

Homology is a way of associating a sequence of algebraic objects (abelian groups) with other mathematical objects (topological spaces).

Persistent homology extends the idea of homology to study the evolution of topological features in a space across different spatial scales.   Persistent homology is a method for computing topological features of a space at different spatial resolutions.

"Data have shape, and shape matter." I don't know where this quote comes from, but it is a good saying. TDA aims to extract information about the shape and structure of data, especially high-dimensional and complex datasets.

From the data, we get its shape. From that, we analyse the topological features.

Property of topology:
    1. Coordinate invariant
    2. Deformation invariant
    3. Compressed representations

In image analysis, persistent homology can be used to study the topological features of images. It helps in understanding the shapes and patterns present in the data.

Network Representation:
- Images can be represented as networks, where pixels or regions are nodes, and connections represent relationships. TDA can be applied to analyze the topological properties of these networks, aiding in segmentation tasks.
