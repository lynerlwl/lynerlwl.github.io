# How to learn GNN for image segmentation

First, we need to know graph structure. This [slide](https://www.cb.uu.se/~filip/ImageProcessingUsingGraphs/LectureNotes/Lecture1.pdf) is good introduction. 

This [article](https://ericmjl.github.io/essays-on-data-science/machine-learning/graph-nets/) to get an overall idea of how GNN works.


Once you got the foundation, study this [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn).
