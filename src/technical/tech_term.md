[Social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science) is the branch of science devoted to the study of societies and the relationships among individuals within those societies.

[Theoretical computer science (TCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science) is a subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on mathematical aspects of computer science such as the theory of computation, lambda calculus, and type theory.

[Algorithmic game theory (AGT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_game_theory) is an area in the intersection of game theory and computer science, with the objective of understanding and design of algorithms in strategic environments.

[Online algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm) is one that can process its input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion.

[Approximation algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_algorithm) are efficient algorithms that find approximate solutions to optimization problems (in particular NP-hard problems) with provable guarantees on the distance of the returned solution to the optimal one.

[Maximin share (MMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximin_share) is a criterion of fair item allocation. Given a set of items with different values, the 1-out-of-n maximin-share is the maximum value that can be gained by partitioning the items into n parts and taking the part with the minimum value.

[Monte Carlo algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm) is a randomized algorithm whose output may be incorrect with a certain (typically small) probability.

[Control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory) deals with the control of dynamical systems in engineered processes and machines. The objective is to develop an algorithm governing the application of system inputs to drive the system to a desired state, while minimizing any delay, overshoot, or steady-state error and ensuring a level of control stability; often with the aim to achieve a degree of optimality.

[Dynamic data structure (DDS)](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/dynamic-data-structure/) refers to a collection of data in memory that has the flexibility to grow or shrink in size, enabling a programmer to control exactly how much memory is utilized.

[Retroactive data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_data_structure) supports efficient modifications to a sequence of operations that have been performed on the structure.

[Ubiquitous computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing) is a concept where computing is made to appear anytime and everywhere.

[Context awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_awareness) refers to a capability to take into account the situation of entities, which may be users or devices, but are not limited to those. Narrowly defined for mobile devices, context awareness does thus generalize location awareness.

[Network communication](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=services-basics-network-communication) or *internetworking*, defines a set of protocols (rules and standards) that allow application programs to talk with each other without regard to the hardware and operating systems where they are run. Internetworking allows application programs to communicate independently of their physical network connections.

[Plant phenotyping](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/biop/plant-phenotyping/plant-phenotyping/index.html) is an emerging science that links genomics with plant ecophysiology and agronomy.

[Intelligent sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_sensor) is a sensor that takes some predefined action when it senses the appropriate input (light, heat, sound, motion, touch).

[Indoor positioning system (IPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_positioning_system) is a network of devices used to locate people or objects where GPS and other satellite technologies lack precision or fail entirely.
