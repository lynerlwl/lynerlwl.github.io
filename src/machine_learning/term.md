[**Artificial intelligence**](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/) is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. 

**Intelligence** is the ability of a system to acquire and process information.(黄铁军, 科学之路 - 序言)

**Learning** is the process of gradually reducing systematic errors. (黄铁军, 科学之路 - 序言)

[**Metadata**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) is "data that provides information about other data", but not the content of the data.

[**Backpropagation**](https://brilliant.org/wiki/backpropagation/), short for "backward propagation of errors," is an algorithm for supervised learning of artificial neural networks using gradient descent.

[**Latent space**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_space), also known as a **latent feature space** or **embedding space**, is a vector space spanned by the latent variables. Latent variables are variables which are not directly observable.
- Position within the latent space can be viewed as being defined by a set of latent variables that emerge from the resemblances from the objects.
-  The construction of a latent space is an example of dimensionality reduction, which can also be viewed as a form of data compression.

[**Manifold**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold) is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point.
- One-dimensional manifolds include lines and circles, but not lemniscates.
- Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces. Examples include the plane, the sphere, and the torus, and also the Klein bottle and real projective plane.

If we have a notion of distance then we can say when things are close to each other. However, distance is not necessary to determine when things are close to each other.****
