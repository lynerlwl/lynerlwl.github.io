What is image segmentation?
- Image segmentation is vital scene understanding process that locate objects and boundaries in an image. 

What is semantic segmentation?
- Semantic segmentation is a task that classify each pixel in the image to a label.

How it is being done?
- Traditional CV algorithm
  - thresholding
  - histogram-based bundling
  - region growing
  - k-means clustering 
  - watersheds
  - active contours
  - graph cuts
  - conditional and Markov random fields
  - sparsity based methods
 
How people doing it now?
  - Deep Learning
  - Fully convolutional networks / fully convolutional pixel-labeling networks
  - Convolutional models with graphical models
  - Encoder-decoder based models
  - Multi-scale and pyramid network based models
  - Dilated convolutional models and DeepLab family
  - Recurrent neural network based models
  - Attention-based models
  - Generative models and adversarial training
  - Convolutional models with active contour models

What's the problem with this task?
    - While the deep learning model is capable to achieve good segmentation result, the technique is highly dependent on big dataset for training.
