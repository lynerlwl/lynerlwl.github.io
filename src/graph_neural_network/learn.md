# How to learn GNN for image segmentation

First, we need to know graph structure. This [slide](https://www.cb.uu.se/~filip/ImageProcessingUsingGraphs/LectureNotes/Lecture1.pdf) is good introduction. 

This [blog](https://gordicaleksa.medium.com/how-to-get-started-with-graph-machine-learning-afa53f6f963a) is a good intro to Graph Neural Network.

Once you got the foundation, study this [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn).
