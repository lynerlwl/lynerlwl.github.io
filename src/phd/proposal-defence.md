# Proposal defence

I did poorly on the proposal draft because I took things too lightly. I have this attitude because I am confused by the word proposal. If the proposal is the one I submit for admission, what more should I include for this defence? I know I sound pretty dumb, but that actually happens. I ended up delaying the defence for four months (three months writing and one month presenting). 

In this stage, the proposal is the draft thesis consisting of chapters one to three (Introduction, Literature Review, and Methodology). You must showcase your problem and hypothesis to convince others that your research direction is clear.
