# Before starting PhD

Before starting a PhD, some research experience is needed. I will share my experience as a computer science graduate in Malaysia. All my research experience is entirely focused only on deep learning. In my Bachelor's final year project, I got the chance to explore image classification using Convolutional Network. That experience just gave me little research exposure, as I didn't manage to complete it. Just so I thought I would say bye to research, a Master's opportunity came up. This time the study is on text classification. So I changed the domain from image to text. I spent my years doing incremental work, adding something to the input and tweaking the model to increase the classification accuracy. I was not too fond of that research, so I looked up something new in my PhD. On why continuing PhD, I want to explore a career as a researcher. I think landing a job with a PhD degree and relevant experience is easier. 

I would want to clarify three things before you continue the reading. Firstly, I am not a bright student with first-class honours and lots of technical experience. I got a second-upper, for those who wondered. I even hated to do coding before I started my Master, but I am not bad at it, just mediocre. Secondly, I was still not good at doing research after my Master, and so did my output. My best work has been published in IEEE Access. Lastly, I also didn't have good English, so writing was not easy for me. The reason I tell you these facts is to inform you can do research even if you are not smart. Just keep the difficulty to your level, so you will be motivated, as stated in the [Goldilocks Rule](https://jamesclear.com/goldilocks-rule).

A few things to note before starting a PhD. If you are in a dilemma about doing a full-time PhD, you need to consider your family situation. If your family depends on you, you better work until someone in your family can replace you. An issue other than family issues would be peer pressure. You will undoubtedly meet peer pressure when you see your friends working out there, earning more than you and enjoying life. Oh, did I mention getting PhD would not make you earn more? So, the solid answer for why doing a PhD is to become a professor or scientist. Remember that "personal happiness" is always the priority over "personal wealth". Just keep in mind that you must adopt budgeting as a practice of personal finance.
