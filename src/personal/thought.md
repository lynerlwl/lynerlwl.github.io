Some technical thoughts:
- Engineering is applied science. An engineer who doesn't know science is not an engineer.
- The learning gap is a serious problem that we must solve. For example, we know 80% of concept 1 and we move on to learn concept 2. That missing 20% is crucial to understanding concept 2.
- We did not learn from the research paper. We identify the gap and trend from there. Then learn the fundamentals from the textbook.

Some life thoughts:
- It is hard to maintain the same state in life. If you can't improve then you likely deteriorate. Truth is always harsh, seek out honest feedback and learn from it. You got to thank those people who speak the truth, they risk their relationship with you by doing so. Even if you don't like it, you have to keep your manner. Friends may come and go, but enemies accumulate. 
- People count projects you finish, not the ones you start. The same goes for skill, you tell people what you know, not what you plan to know. When explaining something, keep things simple unless a very good reason not to. Confidence didn't come from how well you know the subject but from your ability to cope with unforeseen situations.

Thought on choosing a full-time PhD:
- If you are in dilemma thinking if you should do PhD fulltime, first think about your family situation. If your family is dependent on you, better go work until someone in your family can replace you. During your study, remember that "personal happiness" is always the priority over "personal wealth". Personal finance is a general term, what you must adopt is budgeting. Though the study process is hard, family first study second.
