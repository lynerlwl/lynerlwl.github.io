# Welcome!

My name is Wei Lun, you can also call me Lyner. I am a PhD (Computing) candidate at Sunway University, where I am also a [Research Assistant](research/project.md) and Teaching Assistant. 

In my PhD research, I work on small sample learning in semantic segmentation. My research interest is mainly on **representation learning** which I am looking at geometry deep learning now (particulary graph data structure). I'm also have slight interst on topological deep learning (particulary manifold learning which make use of geometrical and topological information).

## Teaching Assistant

- Aug 2022 - Nov 2022 **WEB2202: Web Programming**. 

- Apr 2022 - Jul 2022 **PRG2104: Object-Oriented Programming**, **SEG2202: Software Engineering**.
