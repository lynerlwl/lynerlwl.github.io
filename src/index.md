# Welcome!

My name is Wei Lun, and you can also call me Lyner. I am a PhD (Computing) candidate at [Sunway University](https://university.sunway.edu.my/), where I am also a Research Assistant and Teaching Assistant. You can look at my work experience [here](work_experience.md). In my PhD research, I am looking at using the graph to represent the image for semantic segmentation. My list of publications can be seen [here](publication.md). As a computer science researcher, I try to explain concepts in artificial intelligence related to my research interest. I am planning to write about them soon.
