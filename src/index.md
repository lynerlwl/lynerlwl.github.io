# Welcome!

My name is Wei Lun, and you can also call me Lyner. I am a PhD (Computing) candidate at Sunway University, where I am also a [Research Assistant](research/project.md) and [Teaching Assistant](personal/experience.md). I work on small sample learning in semantic segmentation in my PhD research. My current research interest is in **representation learning**, and I am looking at using the graph to represent the image. My list of publications can be seen [here](research/publication.md).
