My name is Wei Lun, and you can also call me Lyner. I am a [**PhD**](phd.md) (Computing) candidate at [**Sunway University**](https://sunwayuniversity.edu.my/), where I am also a Research Assistant and Teaching Assistant. In my PhD research, I study graph representation learning for semantic segmentation. I read on my free time, [**these**](read.md) are the books I enjoyed.
