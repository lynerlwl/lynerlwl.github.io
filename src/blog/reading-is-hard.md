# How to learn by yourself

The basic skill of self-learning is reading comprehension. I will have to first emphasise "reading is harder than you think", to avoid people take this for granted. If you read without thinking and forming your own conclusions, the reading is just browsing the information. It just have little effect on you. 

That is what happened to most people when they read or watch something, their information pool increased, but not their knowledge pool. 

 

Information is not knowledge, if you cannot interprete it. Depends on who reading the content, to some is knowledge, to some is information.

Data -> Information -> Knowledge.

That bring us the simplified equation of Kowledge = Theory + Information. 

Data is meaningless without theory, the only souce of knowledge is experience.

Data is symbols that decribe things. Information is meaningful data. Knowledge is useful info. For example, you saw ddr4 on the box of a motherboard, that ddr4 is data Once you know that ddr4 in one of the specs of a motherboard, that become an information. Knowledge comes in when you know you need to install RAM stick with ddr4 to the motherboard for the PC to run and not ddr5.

Learning is never easy. I end this article with the idea of Denis Diderot (French Philosopher) on acquiring knowledge. He stated that there are three principal means of acquiring knowledge: (1) observation of nature, (2) reflection, and (3) experimentation. Observation collects facts; reflection combines them; experimentation verifies the result of that combination.
