Let's first look at motherboard. Take out the plastic cover at the CPU slot. Then, take out CPU from the CPU package. Put the CPU into the slot following the arrow direction at the bottom. Next, plug RAM into the slot that located at the right of CPU slot. The left and right side of the ram is different, so just slot them according to the slot length. In my case, the side with logo is facing right.
