# Research

Research is a long process, when done in a wrong mood, it becomes dull. Like other career, your body decide your outcome. To perform well in research, you must make sure you got enough sleep, healthy diet, and enough exercise. Secondly, the environment. There is no a fixed place to conduct your research, it changes like you mood.

1. **Quatitative** vs **Qualitative** research
    -  Process of collecting and analyzing *numerical* vs *nonnumerical* data.

2. About **Reading** and **Writing** 
    - You have to read and write often, at least 2 days per week. Just like go to gym, have to be consistent. After reading one article, record the main takeaway. 
    - Writing thesis is NOT the same as writing article, thought both are a kind of report. Thesis is meant for everyone to read, have to write clearly. Article is for expert to get the latest update. 

3. When reading an article
    - In first read, focus on abstract, introduction, conclusion. Always read multiple times until you think it is enough. So you shouldn't spend too long time on single paper.

4. When writing an article, there's few choices:
    - A research article is normally refereed, and it is prepared from other report published earlier. It can be **journal** or **conference** paper. 
      - Journal paper contain more pages thus can include more information, it is suitable for review paper & extended work of conference paper. 
      - Conference paper contain less information as it is limited by page numbers. Only in the field of CS and EE, conference paper is view pretigious than journal paper. 
    - A technical report is written with a view to keeping a claim on the matter concerned should the need arise later. It is not referred.   
    - The content should be in details that is sufficient for others to reproduce the results.

5. On choosing a research *topic*, rememeber to solve problem that others think is important.

6. About *collaboration*:  
    - Choose members carefully, 1 expert per area reduce disagreements.

7. Important
   - Research = Read + Search
   - CS = Algorithm + Data Structure + Protocol
   - Half problems solved when found problem
   - Discipline problem > Technical problem
   - Record what you do per day 给自己一个交代
