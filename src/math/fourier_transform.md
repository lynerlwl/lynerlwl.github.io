# Fourier transform

[Fourier transform (FT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) decomposes functions depending on space or time into functions depending on spatial frequency or temporal frequency. Fourier transform refers to both the frequency domain representation and the mathematical operation that associates the frequency domain representation to a function of space or time.
