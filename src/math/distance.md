# Distance Measure

The Euclidean distance between two vectors is the square root of the sum of the squared differences between them.

The Manhattan distance between two vectors is the sum of their absolute differences.

The Hamming distance computes the distance between two binary vectors.

The Minkowski distance is a generalization of the Euclidean and Manhattan distances that we can tune depending on which distance measure we need.
