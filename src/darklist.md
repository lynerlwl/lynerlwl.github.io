# Darklist - Record of good iced chocolate from cafe around Malaysia

Staying in an identical environment for a long time is not good for mental health. So, going to a new place occasionally tackles that issue and gives you a new experience. Well, I'm going to talk about one of the getaways of city people: cafe hopping. Spending time alone or with friends in a chill cafe sounds good as the remedy for a busy pace, right? I will record my visit to the cafe along with their chocolate drinks as one of the verdicts, as I don't drink coffee much. Hence, this page is called dark list, as I like dark chocolate. But "chocolate + water" is not as good as "chocolate + milk", as the milk gives a smooth flavour. Iced chocolate is priced between the range of RM10 and RM16. It won't only be a good one, right? So, I will have the good (dark) and bad (brown) list.
